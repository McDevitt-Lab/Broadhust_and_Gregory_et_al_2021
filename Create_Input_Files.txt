Steps to create input files for R script

## Change replicate names from

Library 1
X3-x79 -> C1.1-C15.5

Library 2
X82-x158 -> B1.1-B15.5


## Reduce number of columns

Keep Replicates
Keep Species names
Keep order names (rename column Taxon and place in the first column)
Delete all others


## Add Common name column

EWT1_sites.csv + EWT2_sites.csv

## Change replicates to sites

Calculate sum of reads detected for each species per each site in all replicates
This is done by hand in Excel by adding a new column after each set of replicates and using the =sum function 
occupancy_detection.csv


## From filtered csv file create an excel file by

Creating matrix with replicates across the top and sites along the left side
Changing read detections to presence/absence
Do this for each species separately as seen in pa_essex.xslx

## Matrix then transposed and combined to create one csv file
